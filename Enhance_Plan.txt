ROSES Prompt: Firebase Static HTML Form Loading Data from Excel

🔹 R — Role

You are a senior front-end engineer and Firebase Hosting expert.
You specialize in:

- Building responsive HTML forms that work in a **pure static environment** (Firebase `public` folder, no backend).
- Loading `.xlsx` data in the browser using client-side JavaScript (e.g., SheetJS via CDN).
- Writing **clear setup instructions** in plain language for non-developers.

You write **clean, well-commented code** and explain how to customize it.

---

🔹 O — Objective

Create a complete, ready-to-use solution that:

1. Generates an `index.html` form page for Firebase Hosting.
2. Loads all question data from an Excel file (`Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.xlsx`) placed in the same public folder.
3. Uses the visual layout and form structure inspired by `form.html`.
4. Is easy to maintain: when the Excel file changes, the form updates automatically (no hardcoded questions).
5. Includes a simple step-by-step guide in `.txt` form for setup and configuration.

---

🔹 S — Scenario

Context:

- I am hosting a static website using **Firebase Hosting**.
- I have a `public` (static) folder where I will place:
  - `index.html`  ← new form page you will build
  - `Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.xlsx` ← source of questions/content
- I want the questions and labels in `index.html` to come from the Excel file, **not hardcoded in HTML**.

Technical constraints:

- This must work from a **static site only** (no Node.js backend, no server code).
- Use **plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.
- You may use **browser-based libraries via CDN**, such as:
  - A library to read `.xlsx` files in the browser (e.g. SheetJS).
- The page must be **responsive**: usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

You will NOT actually run or host Firebase; just provide code and a guide I can follow.

Files available for you to review in this chat:

- `Plan.txt` (high-level plan)
- `form.html` (reference layout and UX)
- `Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.xlsx` (data source)

🔹 E — Expected Solution

Your final answer must include **all of the following**, in order:

1. **Short overview (2–4 sentences)**
   - Explain the overall approach in simple, non-technical language.

2. **`index.html` full code (complete file)**
   - Valid HTML5 document.
   - Includes:
     - Responsive layout (using CSS in `<style>` or simple classes).
     - A `<form>` that follows the structure and look & feel of `form.html`.
     - `<script>` section that:
       - Loads the Excel-reading library from a CDN.
       - Loads `Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.xlsx` from the same folder.
       - Parses the Excel file (based on its sheet structure/columns).
       - Dynamically generates the question fields in the form (no hardcoded text).
     - Clear **comments** explaining:
       - Where to change the Excel file name if needed.
       - How each Excel column maps to form fields (e.g., question text, type, options, etc.).

3. **Configuration notes**
   - Brief section explaining:
     - Which **sheet** and **columns** in `Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.xlsx` you used.
     - How to change the mapping if the Excel structure changes.
     - Any limitations (for example, must be accessed via HTTP/HTTPS, not just double-clicking the file).

4. **`instructions.txt` content (plain text)**
   - Write the content I should save as `instructions.txt`.
   - Step-by-step, in simple language, explain:
     1. How to place the files in the Firebase `public` folder:
        - `index.html`
        - `Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.xlsx`
        - (Optional) any CSS/JS assets if you separate them.
     2. How to **deploy** using Firebase Hosting (`firebase init`, `firebase deploy` – explained briefly).
     3. How to **update questions**:
        - Open the Excel file.
        - Edit/add/remove questions.
        - Save it with the same name.
        - Redeploy (if needed) or just refresh the browser.
     4. Basic troubleshooting tips:
        - What to check if data doesn’t load (e.g., browser console errors, file path, HTTPS).

5. **Future extension suggestions (optional, short)**
   - 3–5 bullet ideas for future improvements, e.g.:
     - Saving responses (to Firebase, later).
     - Adding validation.
     - Exporting responses to CSV/Excel.

🔹 S — Steps (How you should work)

1. **Review the files**
   - Read `Plan.txt` to understand the original requirements.
   - Study `form.html` to copy the general structure, styling approach, and UX patterns.
   - Inspect `Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.xlsx` and determine:
     - Which sheet to use.
     - Which columns represent:
       - Question ID or number
       - Question text
       - Question type (if any)
       - Options (if any, e.g., 1–5 rating)
       - Any other relevant metadata.

2. **Design the data mapping**
   - Decide how each row in the Excel file becomes:
     - A question section in the HTML form.
   - Document this mapping clearly in your explanation and comments.

3. **Write the `index.html`**
   - Create a responsive layout.
   - Implement the form structure similar to `form.html`.
   - Add JavaScript to:
     - Load the Excel file via an HTTP request.
     - Parse it using the chosen Excel library.
     - Generate the HTML form fields dynamically based on the rows.

4. **Add comments and configuration points**
   - Make it easy for a non-expert to:
     - Change the Excel file name/location.
     - Adjust column mappings if the Excel structure changes.

5. **Write `instructions.txt` content**
   - Provide clear, numbered steps in plain English so I can:
     - Place files correctly.
     - Deploy to Firebase Hosting.
     - Update questions later.

6. **Review for static Firebase compatibility**
   - Ensure no server-only features are used.
   - Use only client-side JavaScript and CDN libraries that work in a browser.

7. **Deliver the output following the Expected Solution order**
   - Overview → `index.html` code → configuration notes → `instructions.txt` text → future ideas.

If anything in the Excel structure is ambiguous, make reasonable assumptions and clearly state them in your explanation.
