ROSES Prompt: Firebase Static HTML Form Using CSV Data

🔹 R — Role

You are a senior front-end engineer and Firebase Hosting expert.
You specialize in:

- Building responsive HTML forms for **static websites** (Firebase `public` folder).
- Loading and parsing **CSV files** in the browser using client-side JavaScript.
- Writing clear, commented code and simple setup instructions for non-developers.

---

🔹 O — Objective

Create a complete, ready-to-use solution that:

1. Generates an `index.html` form for Firebase Hosting.
2. Loads question data from a CSV file (Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.csv) placed in the same public folder.
3. Uses the visual layout and structure inspired by `enhance_form.html` (which I will provide).
4. Is easy to update by simply replacing the CSV file (no hardcoded questions).
5. Includes a plain-language step-by-step guide in `instructions.txt`.

---

🔹 S — Scenario

Context:

- I am using **Firebase Hosting** with a static `public` folder.
- I will place these files in the `public` folder:
  - `index.html`  ← main form page (you will create this)
  - `Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.csv`  ← exported from `Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.xlsx` (“Simple Evaluation” sheet)
  - `enhance_form.html`   ← example layout / styling (I will provide this only as a reference)

Technical constraints:

- No backend code. **Only static files** and **client-side JavaScript**.
- Use **vanilla JS**, HTML, and CSS.
- You may use a **CSV parsing library via CDN** (e.g., PapaParse) that works in the browser.
- The form must be **responsive**.

---

🔹 E — Expected Solution

Your answer must include, in this order:

1. **Short overview (2–4 sentences)**  
   Explain the approach in simple language, mentioning that the form reads from a CSV file.

2. **Full `index.html` code**  
   - Valid HTML5 structure.
   - Layout inspired by `form.html`.
   - A `<form>` section that will be populated from `xray_questions.csv`.
   - `<script>` that:
     - Fetches `Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.csv` from the same folder.
     - Parses the CSV (using a browser-ready CSV parser or custom code).
     - Dynamically creates form questions based on each row.
   - Clear comments explaining:
     - CSV file name and path.
     - CSV column mapping (e.g., which column is the question text, rating label, etc.).

3. **Configuration notes**  
   - Which **CSV headers** you expect.
   - How to change the mapping if the CSV structure changes.
   - Any limitations (e.g., must run via HTTP/HTTPS, not from file:///).

4. **`instructions.txt` content**  
   - Text I can copy into a file named `instructions.txt`.
   - Includes:
     - How to export the Excel “Simple Evaluation” sheet to `xray_questions.csv`.
     - Where to put `index.html` and `xray_questions.csv` in Firebase `public`.
     - How to deploy with Firebase Hosting.
     - How to update questions later by replacing the CSV.
     - Simple troubleshooting tips.

5. **Optional future improvements (3–5 bullets)**  
   - Ideas like saving answers to a backend, adding validation, exporting responses, etc.

🔹 S — Steps (How you should work)

1. Assume the CSV was exported from `Xray_Evaluation_Questions_Simple.xlsx` “Simple Evaluation” sheet and has logical column headers.
2. Design a mapping from CSV columns → form fields (question section, question text, rating control).
3. Write `index.html` with responsive layout and dynamic form rendering from CSV.
4. Add comments in the code showing where to modify file names and column mappings.
5. Write clear `instructions.txt` content for setup, deployment, and updating questions.
6. Check that everything works in a static Firebase environment (no server-side features).
7. Present the solution following the Expected Solution order.
